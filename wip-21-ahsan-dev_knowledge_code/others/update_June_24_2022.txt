--- This document is to note down the current progress of our paper 3

Things are done:
-- Collect the dataset of Prof. Xin
-- Complete the mapping of the developers of Xin data of GHTorrent to the developers commit author for our 
knowledge unit profiles
-- I run the models with Xin features and the AUC is around 0.80 what is reported in the paper
-- I finished buildingg models with KU count and KU normalized features
-- I finished building staacked model generation and analysis the result
-- All the model building scripts are done in the python, Sypder project named "ltc_KU"
-- We find that the AUC of the stacked models is above 0.90 and outperfming all other models.

All data are avaailable in the Google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vj9tEupJPKsK2MmYAI-FPwJbDclf3XP8
